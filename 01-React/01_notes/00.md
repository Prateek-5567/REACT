        React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, not a framework.
    It focuses specifically on the view layer of applications, providing tools for creating reusable UI components and efficiently updating the DOM.
    Unlike frameworks, React does not prescribe a complete application structure, routing, or state management, giving developers the flexibility to choose additional libraries and tools as needed.
    
    While React itself is a library, it is often used within full-stack frameworks like Next.js or React Router, which add features such as server-side rendering, routing, and data fetching.
