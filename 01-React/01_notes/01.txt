-> to search on most of the softwares shortcut is cmd + p.

-> npx is node package executer. (to execute node files/.)

        prefer npx as mostly you just want to execute your files.

-> npm is node package manager. (no manage node package).

-> SOMETIMES you don't want to install npm entirely on your system you just need to execute files so npx is light and useful.



#### `npx create react app 01ReactBasics ` 
      -> the bulky package is installed using `create react app` command.  

     ->  use : npm run start      or      npm start        or  npm dev  etc scripts in terminal to run your project .

     -> use : npm run build       -> to make build folder 

     -> in this way your node modules will be preinstalled , you will get some extra dependencies in package.json like testing libraries , scripts etc.



#### `npm create vite@latest ` 
      -> go to react vite website to know how to setup vite project .

      -> npm create vite@latest  + Enter => then give details of your vite project. 

      -> vite is a bundler ; ls and ls -a commands -> to list documents and hidden docs.

      -> your node module will not be preinstalled use ` npm install `  to get it. (without this step project will not run .)

      -> then run it using any of the script except build cuz that is used for deployment.



initially used files -> Index.js , Index.css , App.css , App,js
