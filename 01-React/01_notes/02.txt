React produces spa's single page applications ; there is always single index.html file ; react hai to kahi na nahi js bhi hogi and to run js html needs to be injected somewhere. js enabled hogi tabhi apka react project run hoga.

---

1st main file = index.html

2nd main file = index.js that is directly linked with index.html;

in index.js you import react and react DOM

react is core foundational library .

react DOM is an implementation of react on web,

react NATIVE is implementation of react on mobile apps.

---

first of all you need to create a root element in react frontend in index.js

`const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElemenById('id'));` 

now this element that you fetched from html will act as your react root.

inside that root you need to render your components of react in StrictMode

react works on components and react makes a DOM structure of its components .

parent level COMPONENT is ./App  `App.jsx` 

jabh aap components ko import karto ho react me uske baad app unhe tags ke jese use kar sakte ho.   import './App'    =>  `<App / > `   => self closing.

 i.e react gives us power to create our coustom tags (html like tags) and then render them in root. 

import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client' ;  => ye kaam karta h .
