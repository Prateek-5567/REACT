define hooks : 
Hooks in React are functions that let you use React features (like state, lifecycle, and context) inside functional components â€” without writing a class.

Examples:

useState() â†’ manage component state

useEffect() â†’ handle side effects (API calls, timers, etc.)

useContext() â†’ access context

useRef() â†’ reference DOM elements or persist values

useMemo() / useCallback() â†’ optimize performance

In short:
ðŸ‘‰ Hooks = built-in functions to add stateful and lifecycle behavior to functional components.
