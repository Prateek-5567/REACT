# ðŸ§­ React Router DOM â€“ Theory
## ðŸ”¹ 1. What is React Router DOM?

    React Router DOM is a routing library for React that enables navigation between different views or pages in a Single Page Application (SPA) â€” without reloading the entire page.

    It is the DOM-specific version of the core react-router library (which provides the routing logic).

## ðŸ”¹ 2. Why Do We Need It?

    In a React SPA, only one HTML page (index.html) exists.
    When users navigate to different sections (e.g., /home, /about), React Router changes the URL and renders components dynamically, instead of asking the server for a new page.

    Faster navigation
    Preserves state between routes
    Reduces server load
    Improves user experience
